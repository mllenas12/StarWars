# StarWars App

StarWars App is a project built with React, Typescript, Tailwind and Redux. Is the perfect way to explore the vast univers of Star Wars.

At this moment, users can navigate through the different starships. By selecting a starship, you can access information about its pilots and discover the films in which it appears.

However, to access all this exciting information, you must first log in with your own account. Don't have an account yet? No worries, you can easily sign up using a simple form.

May the code be with you! ðŸš€ðŸš€
